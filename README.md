# Comments & Improvements

I chose to keep my test quite simple and didnt want to add too many extra things but given more time I would add the following improvements:

- Automated tests.
- Better styling - I chose not to go overboard with the styling, just adding a few small changes including responsiveness.
- There is a lot of empty space on the right hand column. I thought about adding a way to see your previous spins but felt that was more a roulette feature than a slot machine.
- A more visual way to show the user that they have won, currently a little anticlimatic.
- Migrate the project over to Typescript.
